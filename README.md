# Automatic-Measurement-System
This project implements an automatic system to monitor the electrical consumption of a single-phase load. It measures key parameters such as RMS voltage, current, frequency, power (active and apparent), power factor, and energy usage. Data is sent to ThingSpeak every minute using an ESP32 microcontroller for remote visualization.
